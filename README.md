# Skin Cancer Detection Project

This project aims to detect skin cancer using machine learning technology. The expected outcome is a machine learning application capable of analyzing skin images and classifying them into two categories: Cancer and Non-cancer.

## Project Details

### Task Overview:
Your task is to build the backend application and integrate it with the frontend and machine learning model. The backend application will serve as a web server handling the inference of the machine learning model deployed to Compute Engine. The frontend application will serve as the interface for the machine learning application and will be deployed to App Engine. Additionally, you will use Cloud Storage to store the machine learning models and Firestore as a database to store prediction results.

### Architecture:
The entire application will be deployed using Google Cloud services with the following architecture:

- **Backend Application**: Web server deployed on Compute Engine.
- **Frontend Application**: Interface for the machine learning application deployed on App Engine.
- **Cloud Storage**: Used for storing machine learning models.
- **Firestore**: Database for storing prediction results.
- **Web Server**: Implemented using Static External IP.

## Task Responsibilities
As part of the team, your responsibilities include:

- Creating the backend application and deploying it to Google Cloud.
- Integrating the backend with the frontend and machine learning model.
- Deploying the entire application to Google Cloud.

**Note**: The frontend application code will be provided by the Dicoding team, so you'll only focus on building the web server application and deploying the entire application to Google Cloud.

## Criteria

To meet the project's requirements, ensure the following criteria are met:

- Created a Google Cloud Project and assigned access to external auditors.
- Developed and deployed backend applications using Compute Engine.
- Deployed frontend applications using App Engine.
- Utilized Cloud Storage for storing machine learning models.
- Used Firestore as a database to store prediction results.
- Implemented a web server using Static External IP.
